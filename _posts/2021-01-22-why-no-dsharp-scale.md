Hey great question!

Good news! Your intuition isn't wrong. There *is* a $$D\sharp$$ major scale. It does exist, it's just... not useful. This is where enharmonics shine. I'll try to illustrate why.

The $$D\sharp$$ major scale would be as follows (following the pattern):

$$D\sharp\ E\sharp\ F\sharp\sharp\ G\sharp\ A\sharp\ B\sharp\ C\sharp\sharp\ D\sharp$$

As you can see, every note has a sharp and $$C$$ and $$F$$ even have double(!) sharps. There's also the fact that $$E\sharp$$ is simply $$F$$ really, but due to theory we notate it as $$E\sharp$$ nevertheless, there's also $$B\sharp$$, etc., etc. Maybe you can kinda see why it could be less than ideal to deal with a scale like this.

Now, while this is an actual scale and is completely valid, reading music written in this key can be quite uncomfortable especially considering there's a perfectly valid alternative. 

What's the enharmonic note for $$D\sharp$$? It's $$E\flat$$. Its major scale would be:

$$E\flat\ F\ G\ A\flat\ B\flat\ C\ D\ E\flat$$

Now this seems much more reasonable. We only have 3 flats and reading it should be completely fine. Key signature is much more simple to grasp and it's just more straightforward to deal with $$E\flat$$ instead of $$D\sharp$$.

You'll learn more about reading and key signatures later on in the course, but I hope this helped explain why some people might just say "there's no X scale" to simplify things.
