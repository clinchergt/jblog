It's been a while since I've used ruby, so it took a bit to tweaking around to get it working (since most distros aren't great at giving you a recent version). `Jekyll` has been kinda wonderful so far. I had only used it once before this time, and I wasn't really familiar with it, and I guess I still aren't, I just set up some posts and that was it.

First thing I'll do is probably post something I had written before somewhere else, move it here, and that will probably be my first actual post.

This blog might actually make me want to start doing some other cool stuff with a domain I share with a friend... we'll see how it goes.

Blog will most likely be about stuff I do during the day/week, depending on how often I update it, and the things I'll be doing most likely will have to do computer science, linguistics, compling, bodyweight fitness, tetris ...and that's about it.

Check out the [my Github page][github] for more info on what I've done and what I like to do. I'd share some other accounts, but I don't think it'd be worth and I'm not that comfortable with it either.
