What is $$\pi$$? Yes, I know it's $$3.14159 \dots$$. But what does it represent?
What's the concept behind the number and why is it so useful? If you know the
answer to these questions, you may very well be able to abuse the concept of
$$\pi$$ and solve the following question in under 5 seconds:

### Quantitative Comparison

A: The diameter of a circle A

B: An arch segment of circle A with a central angle of 120Â°

What's bigger? Are they the same? Or is it simply impossible to tell?

I have simplified a GRE question in order to illustrate the power of
understanding exactly what $$\pi$$ is.

$$\pi$$ simply represents how many times the diameter of a circle fits into its
own circumference. That is, a circle can fit its diameter $$3.14159$$ times into
its circumference.

Now that you know the concept behind $$\pi$$, you should be able to answer the
question I presented above.

The answer is of course, B. The arch from option B can only fit in the circumference
3 times. Meanwhile, the diameter can fit $$\pi$$ times. The arch can fit less
times than the diameter, so it must be longer.

Now, you could probably solve this question picking a radius for the circle,
calculating the length the circumference of the circle and then comparing both
quantities, but by simply knowing what $$\pi$$ represents, you can solve this
problem in under 10 seconds. Now, granted, the original problem had some extra
nuance, but it boiled down to exactly this same problem. Solve time for the
original problem would only go up by a few seconds.

On the GRE, time is just precious, and having a good grasp of basic concepts
can go a long way.

Now, if you think about it, you didn't really do any math to solve this problem,
if you just use the concepts approach. That's the beauty of it. It's way more
efficient; you get to save time and energy. I really encourage people to try to
tackle as many questions as possible using only concepts.
