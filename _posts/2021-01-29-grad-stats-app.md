Continuation of [this post]({% post_url 2021-01-18-gradcafe-data %})

Recently I wrote about GradCafe stats and understandbly, people wanna know about stats for specific schools, programs, cycles, etc.

So I built an app that lets you query the scraped data directly: [Here's a quick overview of the app in the form of a video.](https://youtu.be/5puIG1nuOxg)

The app was built using `streamlit` which made things really easy. The code is available on Github for anyone to check out but it's definitely nothing impressive.

**I'll update this post with a link to the app once it's ready.**
